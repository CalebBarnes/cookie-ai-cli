## Overview

Cookie AI CLI is a sophisticated command-line interface tool that seamlessly integrates natural language processing with command-line operations. It acts as an AI Terminal Assistant, transforming user prompts given in natural language into executable CLI commands. This tool is ideal for those unfamiliar with specific CLI syntax or looking to enhance their command-line efficiency.

**Key Features:**

- **Natural Language Command Interpretation**: Converts natural language inputs into executable CLI commands.
- **Customizable Settings**: Offers various configurations for different AI models and custom API endpoints.
- **System-Specific Adaptability**: Tailors commands for various systems based on CPU architecture, OS platform, type, and kernel version.
- **Response Schema Flexibility**: Supports a predefined response schema for executing commands, command lists, or handling complex operations needing additional user info.

## Installation

Install Cookie AI CLI globally with npm to access the `ai` command anywhere on your system:

```bash
npm install -g cookie-ai-cli
```

## Configuration

### Requirements

The CLI is executed with [Bun](https://bun.sh/). Install Bun with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Initialization

Initialize your configuration with:

```bash
ai --init
```

This will prompt for API service, endpoint, and an optional API key. Settings are saved in `~/.cookie-ai/settings.json`.

### Setting Options

Configure your settings based on the service you are using:

#### OpenAI Service

For OpenAI's Chat GPT-4 API:

```json
{
  "service": "openai",
  "openai": {
    "key": "<your-open-ai-api-key>"
  },
  "model": "gpt-4"
}
```

#### Custom Local API

For a custom, OpenAI-compatible API on your local network:

```json
{
  "service": "custom",
  "endpoint": "http://192.168.8.162:5000/v1/chat/completions",
  "model": "gpt-4"
}
```

#### Custom Headers

To include custom headers in requests:

```json
{
  "service": "custom",
  "endpoint": "https://<your-endpoint>/v1/chat/completions",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <your-token>",
    "Some-Other-Header": "Some-Other-Value"
  },
  "model": "gpt-4"
}
```

## Usage

Input your prompt after the `ai` command or enter the CLI for more complex prompts:

```bash
ai what is my public ip address
```

For special characters like `?`, `!`, or `.`, use quotes or enter the CLI:

```bash
ai
> Enter your command: what is my public ip address?
```

### Error Handling

Cookie AI CLI provides feedback and suggests new commands in case of errors. It tracks context from previous commands to streamline user experience.

## Command Not Found Handling

The tool assists with unrecognized commands, suggesting corrections or alternatives.

### Integrating with Zsh

Add a custom `command_not_found_handler` function to your `.zshrc` or `.zprofile`:

```bash
command_not_found_handler() {
    echo "zsh: command not found: $@"
    ai "zsh: command not found: $@"
}
```

Reload the shell configuration with `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.zprofile`.

### Integrating with Bash

Define a `command_not_found_handle` function in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
command_not_found_handle() {
  echo "bash: command not found: $@"
  ai "bash: command not found: $@"
}
```

Reload with `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile`.
